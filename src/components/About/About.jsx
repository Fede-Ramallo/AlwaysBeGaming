                    <p className='aboutMeText'>Hi, my name is Federico Ramallo but you can call me Fede ðŸ˜‰. I'm a 22 y/o <b>Fullstack Developer</b> from Argentina and really loves video games (As you can probably tell).
                        I like programming and coding since a young age but never found a good timing to learn, then, in 2019 i decided to go to college and study for a major
                        in system engineering, i had to work and study at the same time and was really difficult for me to concentrate and was finding coding really hard.
                        I had to decide between job or the career, sadly, i chose the job (Not my proudes decision) and since then i was really bored thinking what should i do with my life.
                        then with help from family i was encoureged to start coding again, and re-learn from scratch.
                        This is the moment i started to think that coding was not as hard as i made it out to be, now im trying to do more projects to build a portfolio and make a living out of this profession.
                        So please if you are so kind, i encourage you to send me your Feedback about this page or any other project you see. Dont be shy! i don't bite.
                        Also you can see a more indepth presentation in my social media down below, feel free to check it out.
